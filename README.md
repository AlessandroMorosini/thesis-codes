# Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches for Survival Analysis

This repository contains code for my thesis on survival analysis using a lung cancer dataset. It includes both frequentist and Bayesian methods:

- **Frequentist Models**: Kaplan-Meier, Cox Proportional Hazards, and Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) Weibull models.
- **Bayesian Models**: Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) models with Weibull kernels.

### Notes
- The repository is still under development and will be updated regularly.
